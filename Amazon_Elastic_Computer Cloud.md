# Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud(EC2):

EC2 instances are the Infrastructure as a Service provided by Amazon Web Services. Systems and software are literally served in
Amazon's Data centers which build and host those systems. Amazon EC2 is hosted world-wide in a variety of geographical regions.
These locations are composed of regions and Availability Zones. Each region is comprised of Availability Zones. While launching EC2
instances, the AMI provides information regarding the instance. An instance is essentially a server in the cloud. There are various security groups
which can be set up to restrict inbound or outbound traffic. SSH Authentication is done using .pem file for EC2 instances.
